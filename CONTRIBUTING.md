## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

3. Describe your proposed solution.
4. Discuss the feature with maintainers before implementing.

## Pull Request Process

### For External Contributors

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-typology
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines.
4. **Add tests** for any new functionality.
5. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public API.
6. **Commit** with clear, descriptive commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```

   docs: update export format documentation
   ```
7. **Push** your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.
8. **Sign the CLA** when prompted by the CLA Assistant bot.
9. **Wait for review** — A maintainer will review your PR within 2 weeks (SLA).

### For Internal Contributors (Santander)

1. **Create a branch** from `main` (no fork needed if you are a member of the org).
2. Follow steps 3-7 above.
3. Request review from the maintainer team in `CODEOWNERS`.

### PR Requirements

All pull requests must pass the following automated checks (as they appear in
the PR checks panel) before merge:

- [ ] **`Lint & format & type-check`** and **`Test (Python 3.10/3.11/3.12)`** — Ruff, Black, Mypy, unit tests with coverage
- [ ] **`Analyze (python)`** — SAST (CodeQL)
- [ ] **`pip-audit`** — Dependency vulnerability audit
- [ ] **`Dependency license allowlist`** and **`SPDX headers`** — License compliance
- [ ] **`Scan for internal patterns`** — No internal URLs, IPs, or corporate email addresses
- [ ] **CLA signed** (for external contributors)

Additionally:

- At least **1 maintainer approval** is required.
- All review conversations must be resolved.
- The branch must be up to date with `main`.

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting (line length: 100).
- Use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting.
- Use [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings (Google style).
